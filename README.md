In this project I have used HTML , CSS and javascript to develop the front end of the website.
This page is basically a sign up page .
It contains four input parameters - First Name , Last Name , email and password . I have
also included an option to sign up from facebook and Google . I have included the the 
facebook API from the developers facebook website . 
I have added certain elements like , when we hover over the facebook or google button , the color
changes to a pinkish gradient . The page I have created is responsive and adjusts itself as the 
window size and also is compatible with mobile devices.
